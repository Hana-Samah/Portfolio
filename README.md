## Project Details

### Creating a Docker Image and Running a Container
A Docker image was created using a `Dockerfile` that specifies the required environment and dependencies for the project. This ensures that the project can run consistently regardless of the host machine's configuration.

#### Steps to Create and Run the Docker Container:
1. Write the code for the project (HTML, CSS, JS).
2. Create a `Dockerfile` inside the project directory.
