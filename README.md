## Project Details

### Creating a Docker Image and Running a Container
A Docker image was created using a `Dockerfile` that specifies the required environment and dependencies for the project. This ensures that the project can run consistently regardless of the host machine's configuration.

#### Steps to Create and Run the Docker Container:
1. Write the code for the project (HTML, CSS, JS).
2. Create a `Dockerfile` inside the project directory.
3. Specify the necessary instructions in the `Dockerfile`.
4. Build the Docker image using the terminal.
5. Run the image to start a Docker container.
6. Access the project locally by navigating to `localhost:2000` in a web browser.

## Git and GitHub Integration
After completing the code, the project is pushed to GitHub for version control, collaboration, and tracking changes.

#### Steps to Upload Code to GitHub:
1. Create a new GitHub repository.
2. Open the terminal in the project directory.
3. Initialize Git, add the project files, and push the code to the repository.

## Deploying with Netlify
Netlify was used to host and share the project publicly. The platform automates the deployment process from GitHub, making it easy to deploy updates.

#### Steps to Deploy Using Netlify:
1. Register on Netlify using GitHub.
2. Add a new site.
3. Select the GitHub repository containing the project.
4. Set the site name and click deploy.
5. Share the generated link to make the project accessible to others.
